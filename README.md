# Reverend Blue - Band Website
#### User Centric Frontend Development Project for the Code Institute

A static (front-end only) website displaying technologies I have learnt throughout the User Centric Frontend Development module of the Code Institute Course.
I have chosen to adapt the example brief provided, and have instead created a website for the band Reverend Blue.

Reverend Blue is a London based band that plays original music inspired by blues, funk, soul, and rock.

## UX

The site is targeted at fans of the band Reverend Blue, music-lovers discovering the band, and those interested in booking the band for gigs. I anticiplate users visiting the site though mobile mainly, but also desktop.

#### User Stories
> As an individual just discovering the band, I would like to be able to learn more about the members and the music they make. I want to be able to listen to RB's music from the website, watch videos, and to be able to download tracks.
>
> As a booker, I want to be easily able to contact Reverend Blue, using a dedicated contact page.
>
> As a fan, I want to be able to keep up to date on RB's music, via a website which is simple and user friendly, with navigation aids. I want to be able to easily see when RB's upcoming gigs will be, and to book tickets.
>
> As a mobile user, I want to be able to scroll through the content easily, without the need to zoom in and out.
>
> As a desktop user, I want to see asthetically pleasing content, with lots of images.

#### Design Process
This wireframe maps out my initial ideas and design process: [MockFlow Wireframe](https://wireframepro.mockflow.com/view/M4532df4913ed1f6161b71fee797dafb71547727432927#/page/74c6bb192bf4439f9137bca0833f3745)

## Features
#### Existing Features
The website allows the user to:
- Find out more about the band and the band members
- Listen to Reverend Blue's music
- Watch Reverend Blue's videos
- Visit the band's social media sites (Facebook, Twitter, Youtube, Pinterest, Linkedin, Instagram)
- Events listing - allows users to see upcoming events and book tickets
- Contact form - allows users to get in touch with Reverend Blue with enquiries, by filling out a user-friendly contact form
- Mailing list box - allows users to sign up to the band's mailing list, for news and updates, by filling in their name and email address

#### Features Left to Implement
- Add a calendar view as part of the events page (see wireframe). This is a feature I will add when I have become more experienced with Javascript, and when the band have more upcoming events to add to this.
- Link contact form and mailing list through to a database
- Add GDPR pop-up and unsubscribe page for data protection

## Technologies Used

- [HTML5](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/HTML5) & [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS3) - This project is executed primarily using **HTML5** and **CSS3**.
- [Cloud9 IDE](http://c9.io/) - This website was built using **Cloud9 IDE**, an online integrated development environment developed by AWS.
- [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) - **Bootstrap** is used here to create a simple, responsive structure.
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - *Raleway* and *Playfair Display* are imported from **Google Fonts**, a library of 900 libre licensed fonts, with interactive web directory and APIs.
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) - **Font Awesome** (CSS/LESS icon toolkit) used for the social media icons.
- [Hover.css](http://ianlunn.github.io/Hover/) - Hover effects for Nav bar are imported from from **Hover.css**, a collection of CSS3 powered hover effects.

## Testing

**1)** I have run the website in different browsers and devices to ensure all the features render correctly.

*Devices: Macbook Air, Desktop PC, iPhone SE, iPhone7, iPad, Huawei Honor x8 (Andriod), Asus Transformer Book T100.*

*Browsers: Chrome, Firefox, IE, Edge, Safari*


**2)** I have tested all of the internal hyperlinks, to ensure none are broken.
**3)** I have tested the responsive features of the website by checking the website on different screen sizes and by using [Chrome DevTools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/).

*The website was built to be both user-centric and aesthetically pleasing:*

- *When viewing on mobile devices or small screens: pages span one column only to enable easy scrolling; fonts are large enough to view clearly; all icons/buttons are large enough to click easily.*

- *When visting the site from a desktop: pages incorportate aesthetically pleasing layouts (some features running alongside others); images are large and striking; the features of the site are all spaced-out evenly.*

**4)** I have utilised [Cloud9 IDE](http://c9.io/)'s inbuilt [Language Analysis](https://docs.c9.io/docs/language-analysis) feature and [Debugger](https://docs.c9.io/docs/debugging-your-code) to automatically idenfity issues.

*To learn more about these features, click the above hyperlinks to view Cloud9's documentation.*

**5)** I have run my code through an HTML validator to check the validity and syntactical correctness of my HTML

**N.B.** One problem I have come across during my testing is that that certain styles in Bootstrap are difficult to overide, which I've overcome using `!important` tags.
