# Your Project's Name

In this project I have built a static (front end only) website using the technologies I have learnt throughout the User Centric Frontend Development module of the Code Institute Course.
I have chosen to adapt the example brief, and have created a website for the band Reverend Blue.
Reverend Blue is a London based band that plays original music inspired by blues, funk, soul, and rock
 
## UX
 
Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

This website is primarily for fans of the band Reverend Blue. User Stories:
- As an individual just discovering the band, I would like to be able to learn more about the members and the music they make.
- As a music lover, I want to be able to listen to RB's music from the website, watch videos, and to be able to download tracks.
- As a booker, I want to be easily able to contact Reverend Blue, using a dedicated contact page.
- As a fan, I want to be able to keep up to date on RB's music, via a website which is simple and user friendly, with navigation aids.
- As a fan, I want to be able to easily see when RB's upcoming gigs will be, and to book tickets.
- As a mobile user, I want to be able to scroll through the content easily, without the need to zoom in and out.
- As a desktop user, I want to see asthetically pleasing content, with lots of images.


This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
 
### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- ...
- About & news
- Music
- Events
- Contact

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement
- It would be good to implement a calendar view as part of the events page (see wireframe).
This is a feature I will add when I have become more experienced with Javascript, and when the band have more upcoming events to add to this.

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.
- HTML5 & CSS
    - This project is mostly executed using HTML5 and CSS
- Bootstrap
    - This project uses the component library Bootstrap, to simplify and unify the structure of the pages.

## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
